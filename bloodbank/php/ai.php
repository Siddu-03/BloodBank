const responses = {
  "hi":"HI, how can i help you?",
"what is the confidence level": "The confidence level shows how certain the AI is about its prediction.",
    "how does ai predict blood needs": "It uses machine learning trained on past accidents, hospital data, and blood usage.",
    "who predicts this": "Our AI model makes these predictions based on real-world data patterns.",
    "can ai be wrong": "Yes, AI is not perfect. Predictions are suggestions and need medical review.",
    "how accurate is this ai": "It typically reaches over 90% confidence, depending on data quality.",
    "how does the system learn": "Through continuous training on updated hospital and accident datasets.",
    "can the ai predict rare blood types": "Yes, but predictions are more accurate for common blood types.",
    "how is confidence calculated": "It's based on statistical certainty using model probabilities.",
    "does ai consider patient age": "Yes, age is one of the factors that can influence blood need.",

    "who can receive ab+ blood": "AB+ patients can receive blood from any group.",
    "is there a universal plasma donor": "Yes, AB blood type is a universal plasma donor.",

    "how long does donated blood last": "Stored red blood cells last about 42 days.",
    "what are platelets": "Platelets help blood clot and are also donated.",
    "can i donate if i had covid": "Yes, after full recovery and meeting other health criteria.",
    "can ai predict platelets need": "This version focuses on red cell demand, not platelets yet.",

    "what is crossmatching": "Itâ€™s a lab test to ensure compatibility before transfusion.",
    "how do you store blood": "In blood banks, at controlled temperatures to prevent spoilage.",
    "why is blood donation important": "It saves lives in emergencies, surgeries, and chronic illness cases.",
    "how many people need blood daily": "Thousands of people across the country need blood each day.",
